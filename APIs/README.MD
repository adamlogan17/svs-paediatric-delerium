# APIs

## Summary

This is a collection of endpoints for the Audit and E-Learning applications. It is important to note that a few of these endpoints will not work correctly as they require the database to be running.

## How to start the project

Run the below commands.

```console
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

## How to run tests

```console
npm run test
```

## File Structure Explanation

- Each file within the ```src``` folder represents a service within the application
- Each file within the ```test``` folder are tests for a specific service

## Typescript File

The below command is how Typescript files can be ran. Note that you require to be in the same directory as the file you wish to run.

```console
npx ts-node file.ts
```

Before the first time you run the program you need to use the command ```npm install```

## TODO

- Need to see the correct place to store the test folder and the ```jest.config.js``` file
  - Change the ```rootDir``` back to ```./src``` when the above issue is fixed
